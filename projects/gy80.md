# Sensor fusion

## Overview

The aim of this project is to learn sensor fusion algorithms and implement them on ARM microcontroller.

### GY-80

GY-80 is a cheap sensor board. Available on Ebay and DealExtreme.

## Project assumptions

The purpose of this project is to provide sensor fusion solution using low-cost sensor board.

## Phase I

  * Build a I2C ↔ PClink
  * Set up sensors
  * Read data periodically
  * Plot the data

### Launchpad connections

  * Serial transmission parameters: `115200 8N1`

| ---  | --- |
| 1.1  | GY-80 VCC_3.3V |
| 1.10 | GY-80 SDA |
| 1.9  | GY-80 SCL |
| GND  | GY-80 GND |

### Source code

* [Processing_GUI](/projects/gy80-processing)

### Screenshots

Notes:

  * Scaling is being adjusted in real time, shake sensor board to set maximum values so graph can be scaled to fit the window.
  * Keys `1` to `-` turn on/off plotting value
  * Key `c` clears the window

## Phase II

  * Implement 1D Kalman filter 

### Screenshots

Notes:

* Key `k` - toggles filtered graph
* Key `m` - toggles measured value 

### Source code

* ARM code unchanged
* [Processing_GUI](/projects/gy80-processing#kalman)

## Phase III

* 2D Sensor fusion

Following graph show angle measurement using accelerometer (red) and gyroscope (blue). Gyro clearly shows error-induced drift.

### Complementary filter

Complementary filter is a good alternative for small systems. <http://web.mit.edu/scolton/www/filter.pdf>

### Comparison

![alt](/projects/kalman/gy-80_kalmanvscomplf.png)

Filters:
  * Red - Complementary
  * Green - Kalman

While both methods provided unbiased value, the Kalman filter provided more stable readout. 
Present-day MCUs provide sufficient power to use Kalman filter in real-time.

## Phase IV
  * Build balancing robot.

<http://www.youtube.com/v/CwFBXYt4UKg?.swf?420×315>

The robot consists of 5 parts: Tamiya gearbox, double H-bridge driver, Bluetooth wireless module, Stellaris launchpad board and GY-80 sensor board.
The power is provided externally.

GY-80 board provides accelerometer and gyro sensor measurement at 100 [Hz] (UPS variable). Sensor data is then processed by kalman filter and feed into PI controller.
Control signal is driving PWM output driving motors H bridges. 

Notes:
  * The stability is good but not perfect
  * Kalman filter response was rally bad. I have boosted the response by multiplying angular acceleration value. Estimated angle value has overshot now but is fast enough.
  * Robot motors are powered externally. Wires are influencing robot stability.
  * Taller robot would be much better (bigger moment of inertia).
  * Both robot wheels are independent. Connected wheels would work much better reducing yaw.
