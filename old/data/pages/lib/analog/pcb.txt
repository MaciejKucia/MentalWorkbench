===== PCB Design =====

General tips:

  - Ordered List Item Up to 1 GHz you can still use normal FR4 PCB. (I used this with good results up to around 1.6Ghz for GPS amplifiers) Don't use the 64mil thickness, go for 32mil or so.
  - Short tracks. Use the correct width to match 50Ohm, mitered corners etc.
  - Good groundplane's
  - Plenty of vias, especially the ones next to microstrip lines.
  - Don't use groundplane under osc tank circuits. (Variation in temp can cause capacitance to vary)
  - Follow application layout guidelines where possible.
  - Keep coils/inductors at right angles to each other when they are closely spaced.
  - When crossing tracks, on layers, cross at right angles for minimum interference between them
  - Thin long tracks radiate, short thick ones less so.
  - Keep tracks away from each other by at least 1.5 times the thickness of your pcb for minimal coupling.

Despite these conclusions, there are a few simple reasons to continue to avoid 90° angles:
  * There is a higher possibility of an acid-trap forming during etching on the inside of the angle (especially in acute angles). An acid trap causes over-etching which can be a yield issue in PCBs with small trace widths.
  * Routing at 45° typically reduces overall trace length. This practice frees board area, reduces current loops, and improves both EMC emissions and immunity.
  * It looks better. This consideration is an important factor for anyone who appreciates the art of PCB layout.
