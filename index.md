## About

This website began in 2009 and was originally hosted on my university's server
(my alma mater is the [AGH University of Krakow](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/)),
using a PHP-based [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/).

Although DokuWiki is still going strong after all these years, I decided to
move the content to [GitHub](https://github.com/MaciejKucia/MentalWorkbench)
and use a static site generator: [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

The motivation behind leaving DokuWiki was to preserve the content on GitHub
while reducing maintenance and minimizing security risks.

Some of the original articles are in Polish, but I have since switched
to English.

I tend to post on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciej-kucia/) nowadays.
